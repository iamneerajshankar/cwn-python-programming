Zip Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The zip function in Python is used to combine two or more iterables (e.g., lists, tuples) element-wise.
2. Returns the zip object after combining corresponding items both iterables as tuple. 
3. When using the zip function with iterables of different lengths, the resulting iterator will have as many elements 
   as the shortest iterable. The excess elements from the longer iterables will be ignored.

Syntax: zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)
